# Network-Sniffer

## Overview

This Python project is a basic network sniffer that captures and analyzes network traffic. The sniffer is built using the `Scapy` library, which provides powerful packet manipulation capabilities. The sniffer captures Ethernet frames, IP packets, and checks for both TCP and UDP segments, displaying relevant information for each captured packet.

## Features

- **Ethernet Frame Analysis**: Captures and displays source and destination MAC addresses.
- **IP Packet Analysis**: Captures and displays source and destination IP addresses, and the protocol used.
- **TCP Segment Analysis**: Captures and displays source and destination ports for TCP packets.
- **UDP Datagram Analysis**: Captures and displays source and destination ports for UDP packets.

## Requirements

To run this network sniffer, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- `Scapy` library
